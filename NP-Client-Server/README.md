## Task Description
In this project we should implemented a protocol stack, namely a transport protocol based on UDP, a session-level security protocol inspired by SSL/TLS, and an application-level protocol.
You must present this project as a client and a server, both using a library that contains the protocol logic.
The library must be made up of 3 modules, for each level of the protocol stack, with a well-defined API and that adheres to the layered architecture.
For transport and session level protocols the BSD Sockets API is a recommended source of inspiration, while for the application-level protocol something that resembles an HTTP client API is a recommended source of inspiration.

## File List
- HttpServerApplication.java
- UDPClient.java
- UDPServer.java
- Packet.java
- AES.java


## Implementation 

I have the following features implemented in my project :
* Client
* Server and HttpServer
* Simulation routing of network packets
* Encryption algorithm using AES – Advanced Encryption Standard

-------------------------

I have tried to implement program that enables reliable data transfer between a server and a client over the UDP protocol using DatagramChannel.
Also I have tried to simulate application-level protocol something that resembles an HTTP client API using "GET" and "POST" requests.
This HTTP client API have been based on file manager example between client ans server.

---------------------

#### Server

My server is being initialized in the HttpServerApplication.java class where we can set a port number and any directory for the file managing.
So after we run the program, it reads user input, where we can figure out the port number Ex.(-p 8080) or out file directory path Ex.(-d C:\Users\tanya\HttpServerApplication.java)
After server had been launched, listener( ) method listens to client requests on connection.

The main logic is included in the UDPServer.java class.
The java.nio.channels.DatagramChannel class does not have any public constructors. 
Instead, I have created a new DatagramChannel object using the static open( ) method.
This channel is not initially bound to any port. To bind it, you need to access the channel's peer
DatagramSocket object using the socket:
```
 public void listenAndServe( int port, String directory) throws IOException {
        try (DatagramChannel channel = DatagramChannel.open()) {
            channel.bind(new InetSocketAddress(port));
            System.out.println("" + channel.getLocalAddress());
            ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer
                    .allocate(Packet.MAX_LEN)
                    .order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);
```
We start to listen to any client request. 
Also I have used ByteBuffer for my all data.
The receive( ) method writes datagram packet from the channel into a ByteBuffer.
```
                buf.clear();
                SocketAddress router = channel.receive(buf);
                // Parse a packet from the received raw data.
                buf.flip();
                Packet packet = Packet.fromBuffer(buf);
                buf.flip();
```
 In order to parse received data I implemented fromBuffer( ) method, which creates a packet from the given ByteBuffer to BigEndian.
 So any client message is being handled and encrypted due to the server.
 
 Therefore, the main idea of my project is to show how Http client api working with UDP Server, I have preformed methods which analyse http requests and implement file managing:
 * POST file with text 
 * GET file with text
 * UPDATE(Post) existed file with text(post includes update methods too)
 
 **HTTP parser**
 It has very simple logic in order to simulate basic operations of HTTP API requests.
 
 Client sends request
 
 like string
 ("post -h headesEx. -d body1 test.txt")  which is converted into -->  (POST test.txt HTTP\1.0\headesEx.-d\\body1) 
 
 and server sends response in the following form(using postResponse( ) and getResponse( ) methods):
 
 (HTTP\1.0 201 Created\headesEx.-d\Content-length: 5\Content-Type: text\html\\body1)
 
```
                    method = splitClientPayload[0];
                    url = splitClientPayload[1];
                    requestHeader = splitClientPayload2[2];

                    if (method.equals("get") || method.equals("GET")) {
                        if (url.equals("/") & url.length() == 1) {
                            getFileResponse(directory);
                        } else {
                            getResponse(directory, url);
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (splitClientPayload2.length > 3) {
                            requestEntityBody = splitClientPayload2[4];
                        }
                        postResponse(directory, url, requestEntityBody);
                    }

                    serverResponse = responseVersion + " " + statusCode + " " + phrase + "\\" + responseHeader + "\\" + "\\" + responseEntityBody;

                    System.out.println("SERVER: Sending this message to client: " + serverResponse);
```
Also there are implemented methods for "3 way handshake" in order to make reliable UDP protocol to guarantee packet transmission.

--------------------

#### Client

Get request
It accepts client request as a parameter. Written request is split by spaces and analyzed on header presence. 

In order to send this payload to server and establish the connection, three-way handshake operation is performed:
SYN message is sent to the server side from the client throught eh open channel.
Server is set to non-blocking mode to receive SYN message during the specified timeout on the client side.
If there is no response within timeout "No response after timeout" - is printed.

Server code:
```
                    // CONNECTION REQUEST
                if (packet.getType() == 1) {
                    System.out.println("SERVER: Sending back syn ack");
                    Packet resp = packet.toBuilder()
                            .setType(2)
                            .create();
                    channel.send(resp.toBuffer(), router);
                }
```
Client code:
```
                                  String msg = "SYN";            // Creating packet
                                  Packet p = new Packet.Builder()
                                          .setType(1)
                                          .setSequenceNumber(sequenceNumber)
                                          .setPortNumber(serverAddress.getPort())
                                          .setPeerAddress(serverAddress.getAddress())
                                          .setPayload(msg.getBytes())
                                          .create();
                                  channel.send(p.toBuffer(), routerAddr);
                                  System.out.println("CLIENT: Sending SYN request to the router address: " + routerAddr);
```
Otherwise, we receive a packet sent from the server with SYN-ACK message. After that we are sending and ACK message to the server, which means that we have established connection with the server.

**Also, what is important, we check whether sequence number remained the same.**

Only if it remained the same, we finish three-way handshake.
Now we can send our payload to the server. Packet is constructed and sent to the server and client is waiting for the response 
which should be received within timeout set using the selector select() function:
```
                // Try to receive a packet within timeout.
                channel.configureBlocking(false);
                Selector selector = Selector.open();
                channel.register(selector, OP_READ);
                System.out.println("Waiting for the response... ");
                selector.select(15000);
```
If payload is received, it is decrypted using the same secret key and is printed in the client's terminal window.

After all these actions done, connection, 
connection between client through sending FIN message to the server and receiving FIN ACK message back.
Otherwise, connection can be identified as terminated.

```
// CLOSING REQUEST
                if (packet.getType() == 3) {
                    System.out.println("SERVER: Sending back FYN-ACK");
                    Packet resp = packet.toBuilder()
                            .setType(4)
                            .create();
                    channel.send(resp.toBuffer(), router);
```
Post request (Similar to the GET request)

Request is split by spaces and analyzed on header and directory presence. We need to specify directory in order to create a file in which later we will be able to post data that we are sending.
After that http request payload is constructed. Three-way handshake described above is done. Now we can send our payload to the server. 

-------------

#### Packets
 
 So this part was very interesting.
 Each packet has their own properties:
 ```
    private final int type;
    private final long sequenceNumber;
    private final InetAddress peerAddress;
    private final int peerPort;
    private final byte[] payload;
```
Which helped me to distinguish each other. It comes useful when I sent response of some packet, and it should has the same port and address like the previous one.

Moreover, because the original BSD socket API includes the concept of "network byte order", which is big-endian. 
I have wrote methods which Create a byte buffer in BigEndian for the packet.

```
   public ByteBuffer toBuffer() {
        ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(MAX_LEN).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);
        write(buf);
        buf.flip();
        return buf;
    }
```

Also all the packets with different packet type is directly followed by the payload data.
After execution of specific method each packet obtains defined"packet type":
```
 Packet p = new Packet.Builder()
                        .setType(0) //sending get request
                        .setSequenceNumber(1L)
                        .setPortNumber(serverAddress.getPort())
                        .setPeerAddress(serverAddress.getAddress())
                        .setPayload(message.getBytes())
                        .create();
                channel.send(p.toBuffer(), routerAddr);

   Packet p = new Packet.Builder()
                        .setType(3) //closing connection
                        .setSequenceNumber(sequenceNumber)
                        .setPortNumber(serverAddress.getPort())
                        .setPeerAddress(serverAddress.getAddress())
                        .setPayload(msg.getBytes())
                        .create();
```
Obviously sequenceNumber++; increases of each packet.
 
--------------------

#### Encryption algorithm

In order to encrypt my data in the packets despite default decryption I have used AES(Advanced Encryption Standard).
AES is block cipher capable of handling 128 bit blocks, using keys sized at 128, 192, and 256 bits. Each cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using cryptographic keys of 128-, 192- and 256-bits, respectively. It uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting, so the sender and the receiver must both know — and use — the same secret key.

All logic is implemented in AES.java class.
I have used base64 encoding in UTF-8 charset.
Each message that sends is encrypted and decrypted in this way:
```
                String message = AES.encrypt(clientPayload, "Burlacu"); //"Burlacu" is the secret key
                String decryptedPayload = AES.decrypt(payload, "Burlacu");
```

-------------------------

## SMTP protocol implementation
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer email messages. SMTP operates in client-server mode for reliable transfer of data. 

The protocol simulation deals with the main commands (sent in approximately the order below):
- HELO: names the client (the spelling is deliberate)
- MAIL FROM: names the sender
- RCPT TO: names a recipient
- DATA: asks to send message data
- Mail Message: sends the message data
- QUIT: finishes the mail session

The simulation supports a limited range of response codes:
- 220 Server ready: a connection to the server has been made and the server is ready
- 221 Server closing: the server accepted the QUIT command and is ready to close the connection
- 250 OK: the server accepted the command (one of several similar responses)
- 354 Send mail: the server accepted the DATA command and is waiting for the Mail Message
- 550 Invalid: the server rejected the command (one of several similar responses)

After the client connects to the server, the server reports its readiness with a 220 Server ready response. 

The client names itself in HELO, to which the server normally gives a 250 Server hello to client response.

To send mail, the client issues MAIL FROM and normally gets a 250 Sender OK response.
Recipients are named in RCPT TO, normally obtaining 250 Recipient OK responses. 
However the server can reject a sender or recipient with a 550 Sender invalid or 550 Recipient invalid response.

Once all parties have been named, the client sends DATA to begin message transmission; 
a 354 Send mail response is expected from the server. 
At this point, the real protocol would send the lines of the message followed by a full stop. 
In the simulation, a single Mail Message command stands for this. 

The server will normally give a 250 Message accepted response and further messages can be sent. 
Finally, the client sends QUIT and the server responds with a 221 Server closing code. 
At this point the connection is broken.

## How to use
- Run first HTTPServerApplication.java class. In console write your directory with files which would like to manage "-d C:\\..." 
- Run second UDPClient.java class and in console write yor desired command is following format "post/get -h 'header' -d 'body' nameOfTheFile"
- Check file in your directory
